Molecular modeling tool w capabilites for creating/translating between input files for major modeling programs. Also act as a central doc for tooling used in quantum chemistry.

User stories
----
1. As an educator, I want introductory calculations for particular computational chemistry programs so students have a smooth introduction to using these tools

2. As a researcher, I want a tool to quickly cite authors of common quantum chemistry packages in common formats (.ris, .bib, etc.) to make writing papers using QC results easier

3. As a QC developer, I want an easy to use developer interface so that I can update docs for my program

4. As a researcher, I want a tool to easily convert between input files for different QC programs so that I can double check dubious calculations.

5. As a sys-admin, I would like docs on how to set up different QC programs on a cluster to make running calculations in parallel more easy.

6. As a user, I want easy ways to import molecules from the internet (pubchem, CCSD, etc.) in common formats (.xyz, SMILES, .cif, etc.) so I can more quickly create geometry files.

7. As a user, I would like a CLI so that I can programatically create input files to calculations

8. As a user, I would like time estimates for calculations based on known time scaling of certain methods so that I can make the most of my cluster time

9. As a researcher, I would like a database of open-sourced, publicly available calculations so that I can run calculations informed by wisdom of the crowd

10. As an educator, I want pedagogical calculations which demonstrate key concepts in chemistry so that students have more concrete examples of the theory that they are learning.
